   * 3. An element can't be paired with itself, i.e. (1, 1) is not a valid answer for k = 2.

  /*
   * There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the
   * same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least
   * bricks.
   *
   * The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each
   * brick in this row from left to right. If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not
   * considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number
   * of crossed bricks.
   *
   * You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously
   * cross no bricks.
   *
   * Example:
   * Input:
   * [[1,2,2,1],
   * [3,1,2],
   * [1,3,2],
   * [2,4],
   * [3,1,2],
   * [1,3,1,1]]
   *
   * Output: 2
   *
   * ANSWER: We go ver each row and take a count of how many bricks end after a running width (except for the last
   * brick which is not allowed). We store this count in a hash map. For the example above, the map would contain
   * 1 -> 1, 2 -> 1, 5 -> 1 after processing the first row. In the end, the entry with the maximum value represents
   * the vertical line. For the given example, it would be 4 -> 4. Thus, we know to take the cut in the middle of the
   * 3rd brick in the first row, and not at either ends, which correspond to widths 3 and 5, respectively.
   *
   * Time complexity: We look at every brick except the last ones, so for a m x n wall, time complexity is O(mn). If
   * every accumulated width is unique, we would need O(mn) space too for the map.

   * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
   *
   * For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
   * Return its length: 4.
   *
   * Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
   *
   * ANSWER: One way to solve this problem is by sorting the array, and then going over the sorted array keeping
   * track of the longest sequence. That takes O(n log n) time.
   *
   * A cleverer solution is to convert the array into a set, find the beginning of consecutive elements sequence, and
   * keep track of the longest one. We find the beginning of a sequence by checking if the current number - 1 is
   * present in the set.
   * This solution checks each element only once, thus time complexity is O(n).
