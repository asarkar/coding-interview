     * Compute the first n Hamming number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number).
     *
     * ANSWER: Recall axiom 2 in Dijkstra's original paper (https://blog.asarkar.org/assets/docs/algorithms-curated/Hamming's%20Problem%20-%20Dijkstra.pdf):
     * Axiom 2. If x is in the sequence, so is 2 * x, 3 * x, and 5 * x.
     * After some whiteboarding, it became clear that the axiom 2 is not an invariant at each iteration of the algorithm,
     * but actually the goal of the algorithm itself. At each iteration, we try to restore the condition in axiom 2.
     * If last is the last value in the result sequence S, axiom 2 can simply be rephrased as:
     * For some x in S, the next value in S is the minimum of 2x,  3x, and 5x, that is greater than last.
     * Let's call this axiom 2'.
     *
     * Thus, if we can find x, we can compute the minimum of 2x, 3x, and 5x in constant time, and add it to S.
     * But how do we find x? One approach is, we don't; instead, whenever we add a new element e to S, we compute 2e, 3e,
     * and 5e, and add them to a minimum priority queue. Since this operations guarantees e is in S, simply extracting
     * the top element of the PQ satisfies axiom 2'.
     *
     * This approach works, but the problem is that we generate a bunch of numbers we may not end up using. For example:
     * +---------+--------------------------------+-------------+
     * | #       | PQ                             | S           |
     * +---------+--------------------------------+-------------+
     * | initial | {2,3,5}                        | {1}         |
     * +---------+--------------------------------+-------------+
     * | 1       | {3,4,5,6 10}                   | {1,2}       |
     * +---------+--------------------------------+-------------+
     * | 2       | {4,5,6,6,9,10,15}              | {1,2,3}     |
     * +---------+--------------------------------+-------------+
     * | 3       | {5,6,6,8,9,10,12,15,20}        | {1,2,3,4}   |
     * +---------+--------------------------------+-------------+
     * | 4       | {6,6,8,9,10,10,12,15,15,20,25} | {1,2,3,4,5} |
     * +---------+--------------------------------+-------------+
     *
     * If we want the 5th element in S (5), the PQ at that moment holds 6,6,8,9,10,10,12,15,15,20,25. Can we not waste
     * this space?
     *
     * Turns out, we can do better. Instead of storing all these numbers, we simply maintain three counters for each of
     * the multiples, namely, 2i, 3j, and 5k. These are candidates for the next number in S. When we pick one of them,
     * we increment only the corresponding counter, and not the other two. By doing so, we are not eagerly generating
     * all the multiples, thus solving the space problem with the first approach.
     *
     * Let's see a dry run for n = 8, i.e. the number 9. We start with 1, as stated by axiom 1 in Dijkstra's paper.
     *

     * | #       | i | j | k | 2i | 3j | 5k | S                 |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | initial | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2  | 3  | 5  | {1}               |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | 1       | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2  | 3  | 5  | {1,2}             |

     * | 2       | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4  | 3  | 5  | {1,2,3}           |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | 3       | 2 | 2 | 1 | 4  | 6  | 5  | {1,2,3,4}         |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | 4       | 3 | 2 | 1 | 6  | 6  | 5  | {1,2,3,4,5}       |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | 5       | 3 | 2 | 2 | 6  | 6  | 10 | {1,2,3,4,5,6}     |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | 6       | 4 | 2 | 2 | 8  | 6  | 10 | {1,2,3,4,5,6}     |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | 7       | 4 | 3 | 2 | 8  | 9  | 10 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,8}   |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     * | 8       | 5 | 3 | 2 | 10 | 9  | 10 | {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9} |
     * +---------+---+---+---+----+----+----+-------------------+
     *
     * Notice that S didn't grow at iteration 6, because the minimum candidate 6 had already been added previously.
     * To avoid this problem of having to remember all of the previous elements, we amend our algorithm to increment all
     * the counters whenever the corresponding multiples are equal to the minimum candidate.
     * That brings us to the following implementation.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
