  /*
   * Given an array A of distinct positive integers, and an integer k, how many subsets of the array sum to k?
   *
   * ANSWER: Consider the last element of A; it may or may not be included in a subset that sums to k. If it's included,
   * then the number of subsets that sum to k is equal to the number of subsets of A - {A[i]} that sum to k - A[i].
   * If it's not included, then the number of subsets that sum to k is equal to the number of subsets of A - {A[i]}
   * that sum to k. Note that if the last element is greater than the sum k, it can't be included in any subset that
   * sums to k, and the first case doesn't apply.
   * Let dp[i][j] be the number of subsets that sum to j with or without the i-th element. When i = 0, no elements are
   * included, and no subsets are possible. When j = 0, only one set can add up to the empty set
   * (since all elements are positive), the empty set.

   * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, if you're allowed n transactions
   *
   * ANSWER:
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDhu5uGq_ic
   *
   * Let dp(i)(j) is the max profit made by making i transactions till the j-th day.
   * On the j-th day, we have two choices:
   * 1. We make no transactions, i.e. neither sell not buy any stocks. In this case, the max profit is the same as
   *    what was on the previous (j - 1) day.
   * 2. We sell the stock we're holding, and buy a new one. In this case, the max profit is the difference of the
   *    selling price on the j-th day and the buying price on the day the stock was bought, plus the profit that was
   *    on the j-th day before buying the stock. Since we don't know which day the stock was bought, we will try all
   *    days until the previous day (j - 1).
   *
   * Thus, dp(i)(j) = max { dp(i)(j - 1), prices(j) - prices(k) + dp(i - 1)(k) }, k = 0 to j - 1
   *
   * This algorithm works, but has a time complexity of  O(|prices| x nÂ²). The squared term comes from the fact that
   * for each day, we are iterating over all values of days until the current one.
   *
   * Can we do better? To answer that, let's look at the second term more closely.
   * prices(j) + (dp(i - 1)(k) - prices(k))
   *
   * prices(j) is constant for a given j. At the end of each iteration of j, if we compare the maximum value for
   * dp(i - 1)(k) - prices(k) with dp(i - 1)(j) - prices(j), and store it for the next iteration,
   * we don't have to start over from j = 0 every time. That brings us to the following improved formula:
   *
   * dp(i)(j) = max { dp(i)(j - 1), prices(j) + max { dp(i - 1)(j) - prices(j), maxDiff } }
   *
   * Initially, since we have no previous profit, and no stock to sell, maxDiff is negative value of the first price,
   * since buying the stock incurs cost that we have not recovered yet. We reset this value whenever we start from day
   * one, i.e. for every i.
   *
   * Now, calculating the second term takes only couple of max operations(O(1)); thus, overall time complexity is
   * O(|prices| x n).
