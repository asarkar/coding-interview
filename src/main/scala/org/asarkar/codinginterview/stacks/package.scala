   * Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced
   * (well-formed).
   * For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.
   * Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.
   *
   * ANSWER: Put the opening brackets on a stack, pop whenever we see a closing one, and compare if it pairs with the
   * item at the top of the stack.
