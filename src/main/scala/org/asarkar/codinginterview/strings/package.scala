   * Check if edit distance between two strings is one
   *
   * ANSWER: The general solution is to calculate the edit distance between the two strings and check if it is equal to
   * one. See https://github.com/asarkar/epi/tree/master/src/main/scala/org/asarkar/epi/dp/package.scala
   * However, that is a O(nÂ²) solution, and we can solve this problem as a special case in O(n).
   *
   * We run two pointers, i and j, and maintain a count of edit distance so far. While we haven't exhausted any of the
   * strings, and count is less than two, do the following:
   * 1. If s1[i] == s2[j], no edit required, increment both pointers.
   * 2. Otherwise, if the strings are of equal length, then one character can be replaced by the other. Increment
   * counter, and advance both pointers.
   * 3. Otherwise, the character in the longer string can be deleted. Increment counter, and advance the pointer
   * corresponding to the longer string.
   *
   * In the end, increment counter if one of the strings has been exhausted but the other one hasn't.

   * Given a sequence of words, print all anagrams together

   * ANSWER: We sort each word, and group them by hash code. All groups having more than one words go in the result.

   * is O(mn log(m)).
   * We can improve on this by using counting sort instead of a comparison based sort. For simplicity,
   * we only consider lowercase word characters in a string for sorting and hashing. Time complexity: O(mn).
   *
   * Variant: Anagram substring search
   * Given text "BACDGABCDA", pattern "ABCD" is found at indices 0, 5 and 6.
   * Can be solved by generating all subsets of length 4 ("ABCD".length), and then checking if they are anagrams of
   * "ABCD".
