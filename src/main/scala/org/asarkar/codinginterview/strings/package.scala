   * 1. If s1[i] == s2[j], no edit required, increment both pointers.

   * counter, and advance both pointers.
   * 3. Otherwise, the character in the longer string can be deleted. Increment counter, and advance the pointer
   * corresponding to the longer string.
   *
   * In the end, increment counter if one of the strings has been exhausted but the other one hasn't.

   * Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct
   * characters.
   * For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".
   *
   * ANSWER: A brute force solution would be to find all substrings of the given string, and then count the frequency
   * of distinct characters in each one. To derive the number of substrings of a string, we observe that:
   * Number of substrings of length one is n (We can choose any of the n characters).
   * Number of substrings of length two is n-1 (We can choose any of the n-1 pairs formed by adjacent characters).
   * Number of substrings of length three is n-2 (We can choose any of the n-2 triplets formed by adjacent characters).
   *
   * In general, number of substrings of length k is n-k+1 where 1 <= k <= n.
   * Total number of substrings of all lengths from 1 to n is given by:
   * n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 2 + 1
   * = n * (n + 1)/2
   * = O(n^2)
   *
   * If we keep track of the number of distinct characters in each substring while building it, we get a O(n^2)
   * solution. Can we do better?
   *
   * We can! The idea is maintain a sliding window that expands on the right until the number of distinct characters in
   * the window exceeds k. At that point, we shrink the window from the left until the the number of distinct characters
   * in the window is less than or equal to k, and then continue expanding on the right.
   * The algorithm terminates when the left boundary touches the right (only possible for k > 1), or the right boundary
   * exceeds the length of the string.

   * Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum

   *
   * ANSWER: The trivial algorithm for this is to consider each character as the center of a potential palindrome, and

   * but may take O(n^2) time in the worst case. To see why, consider the string "aaaaa". We do zero comparison for the
   * 1st char, one comparison for the second, and two for the third. Thus, we do (0 + 1 + ... + n/2) comparisons up to
   * the middle element, which adds up to (n/2 * (n/2 + 1)) / 2).
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF
   *
   * Can we do better?
   *
   * We can, using Manacher's algorithm. The idea is to cut down the number of comparisons by utilizing the information
   * learned so far, and by making some cleaver insights. Let's introduce some notations first:
   * T: Given string transformed to insert a special character '#' in between every two characters, and also at the
   *    beginning and the end. This transforms every word to an odd-length word, thus allowing us to reason about the
   *    algorithm without having to worry about whether the given word is of odd-length or even. '#' is a random char
   *    chosen such that it already doesn't exist in the given string.
   * C: Center of the largest palindrome found so far.
   * R: Right edge of the palindrome centered at C; R >= C.
   * i: Some index > C.
   * P: Array that stores the length of the longest palindrome for 0 <= j < i.
   *
   * Since a palindrome is mirrored around its center, T[C - k] = T[C + k] for 0 <= k <= R - C. Let i' be the mirror of
   * i with respect to C, i.e. C - i' = i - C. What can we deduce about P[i] knowing P[i']?
   *
   * Case 1, P[i'] < R - C: The palindrome centered at i' is completely contained in the palindrome centered at C. In
   * this case, we can say that P[i] = P[i']. Why? Since there is a palindrome centered at C, T[i + k] = T[i' - k] for
   * all 0 <= k <= R - C. If P[i] could be larger than P[i'], we would have a contradiction. It would mean that we would
   * be able to extend the palindrome centered at i beyond P[i'], but if we could, then we would also be able to extend
   * the palindrome centered at i' due to the symmetry, but it was already supposed to be as large as possible.
   *
   * Case 2, P[i'] > R - C: P[i] = R - i. Why? Suppose P[i] were longer than this: that would imply that
   * T[R + 1] = T[i - (R - i + 1)]. T[i - (R - i + 1)] = T[i' + (R - i + 1)] because there's a palindrome centred at C;
   * and T[i' + (R - i + 1)] = T[i' - (R - i + 1)] because there's a palindrome of width at least R - i + 1 centred at
   * i' (since we have assumed P[i'] > R - i). i' - (R - i + 1) = L - 1, so what this means is that
   * T[R + 1] = T[L - 1]. But this is a contradiction since in that case, P[C] wouldn't be the largest.
   *
   * Case 3, P[i'] = R - C: We know P[i] to be at least at large at P[i'], but it can be larger, since we don't know
   * anything about the characters beyond R. Thus, we expand by launching the trivial algorithm beyond R.
   *
   * Case 2 and 3 can be coded as min(R - C, P[i']), and then by expanding. This doesn't increase the time complexity,
   * because in case 2, the expansion would fail immediately.
   *
   * Time Complexity is O(n), although I've not found a rigorous proof for this, and people seem to be hand waving the
   * analysis. The trivial algorithm takes linear time in the worst case, but how may times we launch the linear
   * algorithm is unclear.
